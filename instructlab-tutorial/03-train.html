      Here are some fun facts about the DeLorean DMC-12:
      The DeLorean DMC-12 was originally intended to have a mid-engine layout, but this was later changed
      to a rear-engine layout due to design and cost constraints.
      The DeLorean time machine special edition can time travel by accelerating to 88 miles per hour.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>So we&#8217;ve added some task-specific knowledge—now what? T</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>he next step is to use InstructLab&#8217;s synthetic data generation pipeline to create a large training set from the examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key insight behind InstructLab&#8217;s LAB method is that we can use the base model itself to massively expand a small set of human-provided examples.
By prompting the model to generate completions conditioned on your examples, we can produce a synthetic dataset that&#8217;s much larger and more diverse than what you could feasibly write by hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can run the <code>ilab data generate</code> command to begin generating synthetic data (by default, 100 data points). Remember, we still need to be serving the model with <code>ilab model serve</code> in another terminal instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock console-input">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-bash hljs" data-lang="bash">ilab data generate --pipeline simple</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During this process, we can visualize the example queries and answers, light preprocessing, and prompts being fed to the base model to generate a large number of candidate completions.
The generated completions are filtered and post-processed to remove low-quality or irrelevant outputs.
This is a critical step, as the model can sometimes generate nonsensical or factually incorrect responses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On a typical laptop CPU, synthetic data generation can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the number of examples and generation parameters.
Using a GPU will significantly speed things up.
The end result is a set of JSONL files in the specified output directory, with a train/validation/test split.
Each line contains an example with input and target completion fields, and feel free to vim to understand how things are working under the hood.</p>
